# Salesforce-Lightning-Examples
A respository of various components I have worked on and commented to understand how everything works.

If you are new to Salesforce;\
Classes is where all Apex Code is located in the SRC.\
Aura is for Lightning Components\
LWC is for Lightning Web Components\
Pages is for VisualForce Pages and Components\

At some point, all of these examples will be showcased and explained in Video and written tutorial format.
